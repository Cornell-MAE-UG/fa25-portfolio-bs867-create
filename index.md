## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am from Albany, New York. I am intending to affiliate with the Mechanical Engineering program at Cornell University. I am hoping to use all of my time here at Cornell to learn more about myself and my interests, especially while I am still thinking of what industry I want to go into to build my career. I enjoy doing new things and having new experiences and taking chances to grow myself, as a person and a student.  

Take a look at <a href="{{ "/projects/" | relative_url }}">my projects</a> and <a href="{{ "/cv/" | relative_url }}">CV</a>.
