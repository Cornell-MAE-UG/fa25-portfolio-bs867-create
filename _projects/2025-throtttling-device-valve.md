In Thermodyanmics, we have discussed many different devices, their functions, and what settings they are best used for. As part of an assignment, I wil break down the functions of a throttling device valve and an example fo an operating condition we can change that would lead to a change to how we analyze the device. 
The primary function of a throttling device is to quickly reduce the pressure by a significant amount by restricting or limiting the flow in some way. There is only one inlet and outlet, therefore, a consistent mass flow per unit time.
